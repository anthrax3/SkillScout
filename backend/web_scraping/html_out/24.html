class="wp-caption-text">Finance Career</p></div><div><strong>Describe your current role: </strong></div><p
style="padding-left: 30px;">I currently work on the support team here at Arbor. This means my daily tasks involve speaking to clients, answering any queries they may have, and solving any issues that could arise. I am largely involved in most new onboardings, upgrades and new installs.</p><div><strong>Tell us about your background before Arbor:</strong></div><p
style="padding-left: 30px;">Before I started Arbor I was at college studying A Levels in Accountancy, Economics and Business, I also did an AS in Maths. I found out about Arbor through a third party called Positive Outcomes, who help teenagers like me find apprenticeships. I always wanted to do an apprenticeship instead of going to University as I felt it was much more practical, the thought of learning through work and real life situations appealed to me a lot more than classroom learning.</p><div><strong>Why did you choose to apply to Arbor:</strong></div><p
style="padding-left: 30px;"> Positive Outcomes called me and told me they had spoken to Raj and Bob (the directors of Arbor) and they were happy to take on an apprentice as long as they were willing to work hard. I read up about the company and liked the look of the role and thought it would be a great opportunity. Raj also told me he was nervous about taking an apprentice on, so I was eager to prove myself and work as hard as I could.</p><div><strong>When did you start:</strong></div><p
style="padding-left: 30px;">I started late June 2012, as soon as I finished my A Levels.</p><div><strong>What have you enjoyed in your role since joining:</strong></div><p
style="padding-left: 30px;"> I have enjoyed every day of working here. Every day is a new challenge and I have learned a lot since being here. I wasn&#8217;t very technical when I started, but my vast exposure to the background aspects of hosting an application have enhanced my knowledge drastically. I am also very involved in the finance sector so my knowledge in that area has grown. I love taking on new goals and challenges and working at a company that is rapidly growing means I am constantly working towards a target.</p><div><strong>What has been the biggest challenge since starting:</strong></div><p
style="padding-left: 30px;"> I suppose my biggest challenge when starting was coming into a world that I didn&#8217;t know much about. I had studied finance but my technology knowledge was quite limited. It was quite hard at first getting my head around all the back end stuff that goes on to make an application usable, there is so much going on behind the scenes in all the databases that I thought I would never understand. However, the team here at Arbor all worked very hard to get me up to speed. I received tons of support in my early days, and it didn&#8217;t stop there, I am regularly being taught new things by the senior members of staff, alongside learning for myself due to pure practice and experimentation.</p><div><strong>What aspects of the technology and business would you like to focus on as your career progresses:</strong></div><p
style="padding-left: 30px;">I am always trying to focus on ways to understand the way the system works. Understanding the application is always going to be a major part of my role, and as the app evolves I need to focus on maintaining my knowledge and being ready to suggest improvements.</p><p></div></p><p></div><div
