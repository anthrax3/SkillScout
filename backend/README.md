This is the backend fool.

Some scraping stuff...


To use the program and store documents such that:
 - Each downloaded doc url is unique
 - Each document has a unique label as a filename
 - This uniqe label is paired with an SQL row of meta data (city, date, title, etc.)


Ensure that the html_out folder has a single text file labeled 'Count.txt' (should be already there)
Ensure the only thing it contains is the number 0 (top line, upper left). Save.

Scraping can then begin and and SQL database relating each document will be stored.
