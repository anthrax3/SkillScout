# SkillScout
This repository is for the Skillscout project and is split into two folders: frontend/ and backend/. 

## Backend
The backend uses Pythons' Scrapy webscraping framework, a Heroku Postgresql Database, and Google's Firebase Realtime Database to build the data used by the front end (a website). 

## Frontend
The front end consists of a node web application using a react-webpack scaffold from yeoman. While the backend is algorithm intensive, the front end pulls data only from a relatively simple data structure in the Firebase Realtime Database.
